# 105torus
The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation: a4x 4 +a3x 3 +a2x 2 +a1x1 +a0 = 0 in python.
We will rather compare 3 iterative algorithms:

-The Newtonâ€™s method,

-The bisection method

... and The secant method.

launch it as ./105torus -h for more help

in case of bad issues, you can change the first line and replace it by the path to python of your pc :)
